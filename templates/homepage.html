        The weather forecast didn't say that, but the steel plate in his hip did. He had learned over the years to trust
        his hip over the weatherman. It was going to rain, so he better get outside and prepare. Sleeping in his car was
        never the plan but sometimes things don't work out as planned. This had been his life for the last three months
        and he was just beginning to get used to it. He didn't actually enjoy it, but he had accepted it and come to
        terms with it. Or at least he thought he had. All that changed when he put the key into the ignition, turned it
        and the engine didn't make a sound.
